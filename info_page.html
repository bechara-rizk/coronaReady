      <h1 class="info_title">What is the coronavirus?</h1>
      <p class="info_text">The World Health Organization (WHO) defines coronaviruses as a large family of viruses that cause illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases.
The name comes from the Latin word "corona", which means "crown" or "halo", and refers to the shape of the virus particle when viewed under a microscope.
"Coronaviruses are zoonotic, meaning they are transmitted between animals and people," the WHO says.
Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, fever, cough, shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), kidney failure and even death, it adds.</p>

      <h1 class="info_title">COVID-19?</h1>
      <p class="info_text">COVID-19 is the disease caused by a "novel coronavirus" which originated in Wuhan, China.
People may be sick with the virus for 1 to 14 days before developing symptoms. The most common symptoms of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.
More rarely, the disease can be serious and even fatal. Older people, and people with other medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes, or heart disease), may be more vulnerable to becoming severely ill. Finally, few people seemed to lose their appetite.
The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so itâ€™s important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).
At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19. However, there are many ongoing clinical trials evaluating potential treatments. WHO will continue to provide updated information as soon as clinical findings become available.<br>People may be sick with the virus for 1 to 14 days before developing symptoms.
